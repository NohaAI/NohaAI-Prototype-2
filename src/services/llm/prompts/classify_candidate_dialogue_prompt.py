def classify_candidate_dialogue_prompt_template():
  prompt="""
      You are an agent and your task is to classify the candidate's response into different classes as defined below and explain the rationale for classifying them as such. Ensure that you classify the response with only the labels listed below and that no new label is created.

      ### **Given Inputs:**
      - **bot_dialogue**: {bot_dialogue}  
      - **candidate_dialogue**: {candidate_dialogue}  
      - **chat_history**: {chat_history}  
      - **distilled_candidate_dialogue**: {distilled_candidate_dialogue}  

      ---

      ### **Preprocessing Steps (Before Classification)**
      Before beginning to classify the **candidate_dialogue**, apply the following transformations:  
      1. **Confirmatory Responses:**  
        - If candidate_dialogue contains simple confirmations like "yes", "no", "sure," assign it **directly** to distilled_candidate_dialogue without modification.  

      2. **Other Responses:**  
        - **Summarize the response** while preserving its meaning and assign the summarized text to distilled_candidate_dialogue.  

      3. **Grammar & Typo Corrections:**  
        - **Fix grammatical errors, typos, and punctuation** while ensuring clarity.  
        - **The corrected version is assigned to distilled_candidate_dialogue.**  

      ---

      ## **Classification Categories**
      ðŸš¨ **Important:**  
      - **Only use distilled_candidate_dialogue for classification.**  
      - **If you classify based on candidate_dialogue instead of distilled_candidate_dialogue, you will be penalized.**  
      - **Choose exactly ONE category per response.**  

      Each response must be classified as **one and only one** of the following:  

      ### **1. technical**
      ðŸ“Œ **When to classify:**  
      - The candidate has **made an attempt to answer the problem**, regardless of correctness.  
      - **Minor grammatical fixes do not affect classification.**  

      âœ… **Example:**  
      - Candidate: *"The corner keys I can think of is it can be a duplicate value."*  
      - After correction: *"The corner cases I can think of are duplicate values."*  
      - âœ… **Classify as 'technical'** because the candidate is attempting to answer.  

      ---

      ### **2. illegible**
      ðŸ“Œ **When to classify:**  
      A response is **illegible** **ONLY** if the **final distilled_candidate_dialogue** meets **at least one** of these conditions:  

      1. **Gibberish or Nonsensical Content:**  
        - The response consists **mostly** of random characters, non-standard words, or incoherent phrases.  
        - More than **70 percent of the words are unrecognizable or meaningless**.  

      2. **Severe Structural Incoherence:**  
        - The sentence lacks **any logical flow** or **any readable subject-verb relationship**.  
        - The meaning **cannot be derived**, even with correction attempts.  

      3. **Completely Unclear Meaning:**  
        - After fixing minor typos and grammar issues, the **core intent is still lost**.  

      ðŸš¨ **Important:**  
      - If the meaning is **recoverable after correction**, classify as something else (not â€˜illegibleâ€™).  

      ---

      ### **3. irrelevant**
      ðŸ“Œ **When to classify:**  
      - The response **does not** answer the active question.  
      - The candidate discusses **something unrelated** to problem-solving.  
      - The response **references the main question when a follow-up should be answered.**  

      ---

      ### **4. interview_inquiry**
      ðŸ“Œ **When to classify:**  
      - The candidate asks about the **interview process** (e.g., duration, number of questions, format).  
      - **Not** about the specific problem itself.  

      âœ… **Example:**  
      - *"How many questions are in this interview?"* â†’ **interview_inquiry**  

      ---

      ### **5. confirmation**
      ðŸ“Œ **When to classify:**  
      - The candidate expresses willingness with **confirmatory responses**.  

      âœ… **Examples:**  
      - *"Yes."*, *"Sure."*, *"Alright."* â†’ **confirmation**  

      ---

      ### **6. negation**
      ðŸ“Œ **When to classify:**  
      - The candidate expresses **reluctance** or **negative responses**.  

      âœ… **Examples:**  
      - *"No."*, *"Not really."*, *"I donâ€™t think so."* â†’ **negation**  

      ---

      ### **7. clarification(specific)**
      ðŸ“Œ **When to classify:**  
      - The candidate asks if **specific knowledge** (e.g., recursion, graphs) is needed.  
      - The candidate **asks for definitions of technical terms**.  

      âœ… **Example:**  
      - *"Do I need to use recursion here?"* â†’ **clarification(specific)**  

      ---

      ### **8. clarification(open)**
      ðŸ“Œ **When to classify:**  
      - The candidate asks for a **general explanation** or **stepwise guidance**.  

      âœ… **Example:**  
      - *"Can you explain how to approach this?"* â†’ **clarification(open)**  

      ---

      ### **9. request(new_question)**
      ðŸ“Œ **When to classify:**  
      - The candidate **explicitly asks for a different question**.  

      âœ… **Example:**  
      - *"Can I get another question?"* â†’ **request(new_question)**  

      ---

      ### **10. request(termination)**
      ðŸ“Œ **When to classify:**  
      - The candidate **initially requests** to end the interview.  
      - **Check chat_history** to ensure itâ€™s the first termination request.  

      ---

      ### **11. request(proceed)**

      ---

      ### **14. illegitimate**

  You are an agent and your task is to classify the candidate's response into different classes as defined below and explain the rationale for classifying them as such. Ensure that you classify the response with only the labels listed below and that no new label is created.

  Given:
  bot_dialogue: {bot_dialogue}
  candidate_dialogue: {candidate_dialogue}
  chat_history: {chat_history}
  distilled_candidate_dialogue: {distilled_candidate_dialogue}
  
  Before beginning to classify the candidate_dialogue (for now, avoid the distilled_candidate_dialogue and the chat_history, else you will incur penalty) please preprocess the contents of candidate_dialogue as per the following instructions:
    * If candidate_dialogue contains confirmatory responses like "yes", "no" etc. 
      - assign the response to distilled_candidate_dialogue without any preprocessing
    * If candidate_dialogue contains other kinds of texts summarize them and
      - assign the summarised text to distilled_candidate_dialogue
    * If candidate_dialogue contains grammatical errors, make the corrections (including typos, punctuations) to the text and
      - assign it finally to distilled_candidate_dialogue
  
  The following is the list of classes alongwith their definitions
  
  When classifying, the distilled_candidate_dialogue must be used (else you will incur penalty) and the 'class' must be one of:
  - technical - Candidate has attempted to solve this question 
  - illegible - Candidate utters gibberish output or non-standard words
  - irrelevant - Candidate responses that are irrelevant to the conversation
  - interview_inquiry - Candidate inquires about the interview
  - confirmation - Candidate expresses his willingness in the form of confirmatory response
  - negation - Candidate expresses his unwillingness in the form of negative response
  - clarification(specific) -  A candidate asks if specific knowledge is required
  - clarification(open) - Candidate asks a generic/non-specific expecting detailed guidance or a stepwise explanation
  - request(new_question) - Candidate explicitly requests for a new question

        * The ratio of non-dictionary/random words to potentially meaningful words is extremely high (e.g., more than 70 percent of the words are non-dictionary/random).

    2.  **Severe Structural Incoherence:**
        * The sentence structures are so fundamentally flawed that it's impossible to discern the intended meaning, even with reasonable effort.
        * The response lacks any discernible subject-verb relationship or logical flow.
        * The dialogue lacks any coherent context with respect to the preceeding question.
